# COVID-19 India Statewise Vaccination Data: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## üìä Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on **state-wise COVID-19 vaccination data in India**. The analysis aims to uncover trends, distribution patterns, and coverage disparities across different states and Union Territories.

The project covers data cleaning, manipulation, and extensive visualization to derive key insights from the vaccination campaign.

## üíæ Dataset

The project utilizes the following dataset:

* **`COVID-19 India Statewise Vaccine Data.csv`**: This CSV file contains comprehensive data on the total number of vaccination doses administered in various categories across all Indian states/UTs, including:
    * Total Vaccination Doses
    * Dose 1 and Dose 2 administration.
    * Dose administration for specific age groups (15-18 and 12-14).
    * Precautionary doses for the 18-59 age group.
    * Population data for each state/UT.

***

## üéØ Key Analysis Areas

The EDA notebook (`covid19_EDA.ipynb`) explores several dimensions of the vaccination drive, including:

* **State-wise Comparison:** Analyzing the total number of doses administered per state/UT.
* **Coverage Analysis:** Calculating and visualizing **Dose 1 and Dose 2 Coverage (%)** relative to the state population.
* **Age Group Segmentation:** Assessing the distribution and coverage for **teenager vaccination** (12-18 age group).
* **Booster Status:** Investigating the administration and coverage of **Precautionary Doses** (18-59 age group).
* **Unvaccinated Estimation:** Estimating the number of people yet to receive Dose 1 or Dose 2.
* **Correlation & Outlier Analysis:** Identifying relationships between different vaccination metrics and spotting data anomalies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Libraries

The project is developed using a **VS Code** and the **Python** programming language.

**Key Python Libraries Used:**

* **`pandas`**: For efficient data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **`numpy`**: For various numerical and array operations.
* **`matplotlib`**: For creating basic and static data visualizations.
* **`seaborn`**: For generating informative and aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics.
